A gamification and visualization tool to make defi more fun!

## Motivation
In the past, Defi primarily focused on financial gains and losses, and users were primarily concerned with their financial performance. However, our aim is to transform Defi into a platform that fosters empathy and healing by extending beyond quantitative measures.

For newcomers, Defi can be daunting and complicated, particularly when real money is involved. Our project seeks to create an intuitive tool that simplifies Defi operations and makes them enjoyable for users. Through visualization, we offer users clear and comprehensive information about their position, reducing their anxiety and pressure.

Incorporating gamification into Defi can increase user engagement, drive liquidity, and expand the platform's user base. Our ultimate goal is to create a more empathetic and healing Defi ecosystem that caters to a broader community of users.

## Concept
Our project aims to create a tool that connects users to Uniswap v3 in a gamified manner. Our innovative concept transforms the process of adding liquidity into an enjoyable activity, similar to feeding a cat. Instead of adding tokens, users will feed their virtual cat with food and water, which are essential for its growth. As users' liquidity increases, their virtual cat will grow larger, providing them with a clear visualization of their position.

This gamification of the liquidity-adding process serves as a powerful incentive for users to add more liquidity. By providing an enjoyable and intuitive experience, our tool aims to attract a broader community of users to the Uniswap v3 platform. Overall, our project seeks to simplify and enhance the Defi experience for users while promoting greater engagement with the Uniswap v3 ecosystem.

## Features
1. Create your kitten by adding liquidity to Uniswap. 
2. Feed water and food to the kitten by adding more liquidity.
3. 1-Click to generate the NFT of the kitten. You can have a growth diary of the kitten. 
4. Utilize the NFT for further usage with the token protocols you provided. 

## Roadmap
Our project has the potential to extend into various areas, and our roadmap for the upcoming phases is as follows:

1. We aim to develop a generative NFT system that enhances the liquidity-adding process. By adding liquidity in different tokens, users will randomly generate unique cats with distinctive features. Each cat will be unique to the user who creates it, adding a layer of personalization and exclusivity to the Defi experience.

2. Our project seeks to collaborate with protocols that lack liquidity on Uniswap. By utilizing our kitten NFT as a certificate of providing liquidity, liquidity providers will serve as the market makers for the protocol tokens. Incentives such as yield-boosting, transaction fee discounts, or even airdrops may be offered to kitten NFT holders. These incentives are intended to encourage greater engagement and investment in the protocol tokens, further enhancing liquidity and expanding the Defi ecosystem.
